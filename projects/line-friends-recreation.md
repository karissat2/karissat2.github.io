For my software engineering course ICS 314, I had to recreate a webpage of my choosing using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). At this time, we recently began learning about frameworks and how to use Bootstrap to create web pages. To make learning fun, I chose to recreate the [LINE Friends Store About](https://store.linefriends.com/pages/about-us) page, as I think the LINE Friends characters are fun and cute. I recreated the web page from scratch using Bootstrapâ€™s predefined classes like Navbar and Container as well as [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/). 

Here is a side-by-side comparison of my recreated page and the real website. 

At the time of recreating the LINE Friends Store About page, I had a small introduction to Bootstrap before creating the web page. However, recreating a web page of my choice allowed me to have a hands-on learning experience and figure out how to use different Bootstrap features on my own. Although it was difficult to recreate the web page since I was a newbie to Bootstrap, it was also a rewarding experience to learn how to create this specific page from scratch. 

My struggles helped me later on in ICS 314 when I had to complete a final project with a few classmates. In my final project, [Manoa Study Abroad Central](https://github.com/manoa-study-abroad-central/manoa-study-abroad-central), I heavily relied on Bootstrap to create the layout of the different pages. On the landing and home page, I used Bootstrap Icons to make the page appear aesthetically pleasing and used pre-defined Bootstrap classes to format text and images on different pages.
