## Software Engineering is...fun? 

Taking AP Computer Science A and Intro to Programming in high school sparked my interest in computer science. However, Intro to Programming, an intro JavaScript course at my high school, heavily influenced my interest in web and mobile development. In the class, we created various interactive projects individually and in groups as we learned about JavaScript. I enjoyed creating and designing simple games as well as building general apps to get the feel of JavaScript. 

Designing my professional portfolio was also a fun and interesting experience. It was interesting to learn about how to build the different aspects of my portfolio and format the different pages a certain way to have a specific look. I enjoyed the design aspect of this assignment and hope to do something similar in future projects or career. 


## Hopes for the Future

I hope that I will have more projects in the near future that can be added to my portfolio and learn more about how to use JavaScript for web development. Although I find web development and design interesting, I lack experience and knowledge. Besides simple projects from high school, I don’t have any other experiences or extensive knowledge on how to develop more complex interfaces. Furthemore, I hope to learn more about front-end development and concepts related to UX/UI Design. Wanting to get into a field that combines my interests in art and technology, I think I’ll enjoy working on the visual aspects of a website, as it will allow me to use my creative and logical skills. I’ve been interested in front-end development and UX/UI Design for a while but didn’t know where to start learning more about the topics or gain these types of experience. Hopefully ICS 314 teaches me more about said topics and provides projects that will help me learn about what front-end development and UX/UI Design entails, helping me decide if this is something I want to further pursue.
