ICS 414, Software Engineering II, was both challenging and rewarding, offering a realistic glimpse into what it’s like to build a real-world application for an actual client. Unlike ICS 314, Software Engineering I, where we mostly worked on practice projects, ICS 414 gave me a valuable opportunity to work with a real customer—Spire Hawaii, a consulting and CPA firm. Spire Hawaii wanted us to create an app that could transform Excel spreadsheets into dynamic, user-friendly interfaces. They wanted a platform where they could input various financial data and visualize the data in an interactive way rather than working with static Excel sheets. This project exposed me to new learning experiences and taught me how to build and maintain a client-developer relationship.

## Applying Classroom Knowledge to Real-World Software Development

One of the significant parts of the course was learning how to handle feedback from the client. In past projects from other classes, my team and I had to design our application based on what we thought a user might need or want. However, ICS 414 allowed us to actively communicate with a customer and fix our application based on their feedback. This taught me more about the professional development process, helping me become a better developer and communicator.

Throughout the semester, I worked on implementing more technically complex features than in previous courses. Since I was responsible for the Executive page of the app, I developed summary graphs for financial data, connected those graphs to datasets, and formatted the page's visuals according to the customer’s UI preferences. These tasks strengthened my technical skills and gave me insight on what needs to be done to maintain a real-world app, including how to fix bugs that were caused by new changes. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with Next.js, a React framework widely used in the industry. Learning how to use Next.js alongside others taught me how to work together as a team to learn something new and apply this knowledge in a meaningful way.

## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work 

Furthemore, this course helped me further develop my soft skills. I was fortunate to be part of a well-coordinated and communicative team, with each member effectively contributing to the project. Each person was responsible for developing and maintaining specific parts of the app, which made task division efficient and straightforward. Our team’s positive and cooperative dynamic allowed us to make consistent progress throughout the semester. Although not every workplace team will function this smoothly, my team was a valuable example to me of what strong teamwork can accomplish.

## Gained Knowledge

Overall, ICS 414 gave me realistic, insightful experience in technical development, client collaboration, and team communication. Now, I have a clearer understanding of the expectations and skills needed to become a successful software developer. ICS 414 was a useful and practical experience that prepared me for real-world software engineering.
